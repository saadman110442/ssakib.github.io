## About Me

I am a Lecturer in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Chittagong University of Engineering and Technology (CUET), Bangladesh, currently pursuing an M.Sc. in Computer Science and Engineering alongside my teaching role. My research interests center around computer vision and deep learning, with a particular focus on video summarization and human activity recognition using advanced models like transformers.

My work emphasizes developing scalable solutions for real-time analysis, enabling better understanding and interpretation of complex video data. Through my teaching, I aim to inspire students in artificial intelligence while continuing to explore cutting-edge research in deep learning. 

I am seeking a Ph.D. opportunity in Computer Science for Fall 2025 to further contribute to advancements in these areas.

## Projects

- **Pedestrian Attribute Recognition using Deep Learning**  
  *Code available on request*  
  Applied Mask R-CNN for its high accuracy in detecting pedestrians. For each detected pedestrian, used CNN architectures such as Inception, Xception, and ResNet, with extensive hyperparameter tuning and transfer learning to find the best model.

- **Bone Abnormality Classification**  
  [Project Link](https://github.com/saadman110442/Bone-Abnormality)  
  Worked on the MURA dataset of bone X-rays, experimenting with the Xception CNN architecture and plotted the ROC-AUC curve to select the best model and operating point.

- **Epicardium & Endocardium Layer Location of Heart with CNN**  
  [Project Link](https://github.com/saadman110442/epicardium_endocardium_localization)  
  Preprocessed MRI images and used Inception V3 CNN architecture to localize the Epicardium and Endocardium layers.

- **COVID-19 Dashboard**  
  [Project Link](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/saadman.sakib/viz/BDCovid19/Dash1Division)  
  Visualized COVID-19 infection data across divisions, districts, and cities in Bangladesh using Tableau.

- **Custom Airplane Detector with CNN**  
  [Project Link](https://github.com/saadman110442/custom_airplane_detector)  
  Preprocessed images for bounding box prediction, trained a ResNet-152 v2 model with Keras, and applied OpenCV for displaying predicted bounding boxes.
